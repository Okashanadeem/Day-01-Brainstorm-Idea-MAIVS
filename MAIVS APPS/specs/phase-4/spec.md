# Phase 4: Integration & Polish

## Objective
Finalize the connection between all services, refine the UI/UX, and prepare for the final demonstration.

## Tasks

### 4.1 End-to-End Testing
- **Flow A**: Register -> List -> Report Stolen -> Admin View -> Recovery.

- Create a `DEMO_GUIDE.md` explaining the steps to showcase the system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No console errors in any application.
